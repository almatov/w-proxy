# w-proxy utility

This is a Python written utility that establishes transparent proxy for ports 80, 443. The program uses Linux iptables.

The proxy transparently spoofs client IP address to the address of the host where program has been ran. One purpose of this program is the remote access via single board computers (like Raspberry Pi etc.) to web based configuration interfaces of any equipment. But the program can be used as usual web proxy to escape restrictions of the client or web server networks. Just browse name or IP address of the proxy host.

The utility was tested under the Armbian Linux. But it should work under any other Linux system.
